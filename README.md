Project Description: Airbnb Clone (Scrimba)
This project is an Airbnb Clone built using React.js as part of a Scrimba course. It replicates the core UI and functionality of Airbnbâ€™s listing pages, allowing users to explore rental properties with a clean and modern design.

The clone includes responsive layouts, dynamic listing components, and modular React architecture, providing an interactive experience similar to Airbnb. It serves as a hands-on learning project to practice React components, props, and state management while focusing on user-friendly UI/UX.
